### **What is a Particle?**  
In physics, a **[[particle]]** refers to a small, discrete entity that carries mass and energy. Conceptually, it can be imagined as a localized object—something that exists at a specific point in [[space]] at a given moment in time. Particles are often associated with **matter** or **energy quanta**, and they follow predictable paths (or trajectories) unless affected by outside forces.

#### **Examples of Particles:**
1. **[[Subatomic Particles]]**:
   - **Electron**: A negatively charged particle that orbits the nucleus of an atom.
   - **Proton**: A positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom.
   - **Neutron**: A neutral particle in the atomic nucleus.
   - **Photon**: A quantum of light, which carries energy but has no mass.
   - **Quarks**: Fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons.

2. **Larger Particles**:
   - **Molecules**: Collections of atoms held together by bonds.
   - **Dust particles**: Macroscopic particles that are visible to the naked eye.

#### **How to Understand Particles Conceptually:**
Think of a particle as a tiny **"thing"** with properties like mass, charge, or spin. It occupies a **specific location** and can interact with other particles through forces like electromagnetic attraction or repulsion. Even though particles may be tiny, they are **distinct** and **countable**—you can, in principle, know their number and location.
