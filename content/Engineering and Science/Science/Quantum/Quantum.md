Objectives:

  

1. Gain a high-level conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics.

2. Develop the mathematical tools required (linear algebra, complex numbers, etc.).

3. Familiarize yourself with practical applications (e.g., quantum computing, quantum technologies).

4. Create a habit of working through problems to strengthen understanding.

  

Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)

  

• Goal: Build a conceptual foundation and mathematical toolkit.

  

Topics:

  

1. Key Concepts:

• Probability amplitudes

2. Mathematics:

• Linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors)

• Complex numbers and complex functions

• Differential equations and partial differential equations

• Dirac notation (Bra-Ket notation)

  

Materials:

  

• Books:

• Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind

• Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by David Griffiths

• Online Courses:

• MIT OpenCourseWare: Quantum Physics I

• Khan Academy: Linear Algebra (if you need a refresher)

  

Activities:

  

• Watch introductory lectures (e.g., Richard Feynman’s Quantum Mechanics series).

• Work through Griffiths’ problems (pick 3-4 per topic).

• Practice solving Schrödinger’s equation for simple systems (particle in a box, harmonic oscillator).

  

Phase 2: Intermediate Quantum Mechanics (Weeks 5-8)

  

• Goal: Understand more advanced topics and strengthen mathematical skills.

  

Topics:

2. Quantum Systems:

• Spin-1/2 systems and Pauli matrices

• Angular momentum in quantum mechanics

• Hydrogen atom (a classic quantum problem)

  

Materials:

  

• Books:

• Lectures/Courses:

• Quantum Mechanics courses on edX or Coursera (for in-depth explanations).

  

Activities:

  

• Derive solutions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of quantum operators.

• Work on simple quantum circuits (IBM Quantum Experience) to apply your knowledge.

• Read research papers/articles on Bell inequalities and experiments on entanglement.

  

Phase 3: Practical Applications (Weeks 9-12)

  

• Goal: Dive into quantum computing, technologies, and advanced quantum mechanics concepts.

  

Topics:

  

1. Quantum Computing:

• Qubits and quantum gates

• Quantum algorithms (Grover’s search, Shor’s algorithm)

• Quantum error correction

2. Quantum Technologies:

• Quantum cryptography (e.g., QKD protocols)

• Applications of entanglement (quantum teleportation, superdense coding)

• Quantum sensing and quantum communication systems

3. Advanced Topics:

• Path integrals and Feynman diagrams

• Perturbation theory (time-independent and time-dependent)

• Quantum Field Theory (QFT) – as an optional extension

  

Materials:

  

• Books:

• Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang

• Courses/Resources:

• IBM’s Qiskit tutorials (to build quantum circuits).

• Quantum Computing for the Very Curious (free book by Andy Matuschak).

  

Activities:

  

• Work on hands-on experiments using IBM Quantum Experience or Microsoft Azure Quantum.

• Create a simple Grover’s algorithm using Qiskit.

• Present a mini project summarizing what you’ve learned—this could be a short research paper or a video explaining a concept.
