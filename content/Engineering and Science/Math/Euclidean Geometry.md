**Euclidean geometry**, the study of plane and solid figures on the basis of axioms and theorems employed by the Greek mathematician [Euclid](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Euclid-Greek-mathematician) (c. 300 bce).

In its rough outline, Euclidean geometry is the plane and solid geometry commonly taught in secondary schools. Indeed, until the second half of the 19th century, when [non-Euclidean geometries](https://www.britannica.com/science/non-Euclidean-geometry) attracted the attention of mathematicians, _[geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/geometry)_ meant Euclidean geometry. It is the most typical expression of general [mathematical](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics) thinking.

## Major branches of geometry

## [Euclidean geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/Euclidean-geometry)

In several ancient [cultures](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures) there developed a form of geometry suited to the relationships between lengths, areas, and volumes of physical objects. This geometry was codified in Euclid’s _Elements_ about 300 bce on the basis of 10 axioms, or postulates, from which several hundred theorems were proved by deductive logic. The _Elements_ epitomized the axiomatic-deductive method for many centuries.

## [Analytic geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/analytic-geometry)

[Analytic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Analytic) geometry was initiated by the French mathematician [René Descartes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes) (1596–1650), who introduced rectangular [coordinates](https://www.britannica.com/science/coordinate-system) to locate points and to enable lines and curves to be represented with algebraic equations. Algebraic geometry is a modern extension of the subject to multidimensional and non-Euclidean spaces.

## [Projective geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/projective-geometry)

Projective geometry originated with the French mathematician [Girard Desargues](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Girard-Desargues) (1591–1661) to deal with those properties of geometric figures that are not altered by projecting their image, or “shadow,” onto another [surface](https://www.britannica.com/science/surface-geometry).

## [Differential geometry](https://www.britannica.com/science/differential-geometry)

The German mathematician [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Friedrich-Gauss) (1777–1855), in connection with practical problems of surveying and geodesy, initiated the field of differential geometry. Using [differential calculus](https://www.britannica.com/science/differential-calculus), he characterized the [intrinsic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intrinsic) properties of curves and surfaces. For instance, he showed that the intrinsic [curvature](https://www.britannica.com/science/curvature) of a [cylinder](https://www.britannica.com/science/cylinder-mathematics) is the same as that of a plane, as can be seen by cutting a cylinder along its axis and flattening, but not the same as that of a [sphere](https://www.britannica.com/science/sphere), which cannot be flattened without distortion.

## [Non-Euclidean geometries](https://www.britannica.com/science/non-Euclidean-geometry)

Beginning in the 19th century, various mathematicians substituted [alternatives](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternatives) to Euclid’s [parallel postulate](https://www.britannica.com/science/parallel-postulate), which, in its modern form, reads, “given a [line](https://www.britannica.com/science/line-mathematics) and a point not on the line, it is possible to draw exactly one line through the given point parallel to the line.” They hoped to show that the alternatives were logically impossible. Instead, they discovered that consistent non-Euclidean geometries exist.

## Topology

Topology, the youngest and most sophisticated branch of geometry, focuses on the properties of geometric objects that remain unchanged upon continuous deformation—shrinking, stretching, and folding, but not tearing. The continuous development of topology dates from 1911, when the Dutch mathematician [L.E.J. Brouwer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Luitzen-Egbertus-Jan-Brouwer) (1881–1966) introduced methods generally applicable to the topic

**analytic geometry**, mathematical subject in which algebraic symbolism and methods are used to represent and solve problems in geometry. The importance of [analytic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytic) geometry is that it establishes a correspondence between geometric curves and [algebraic equations](https://www.britannica.com/science/algebraic-equation). This correspondence makes it possible to reformulate problems in geometry as equivalent problems in [algebra](https://www.britannica.com/science/algebra), and vice versa; the methods of either subject can then be used to solve problems in the other. For example, computers create animations for display in games and films by manipulating algebraic equations.
