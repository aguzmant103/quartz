The case for protocol specs:
- what a protocol does, public good, part of lifecycle
- tcp/io, https/https, tls/ssl, etc. eips, bips, ietf, vac rfcs, pse rfcs
- good: tls 1.3, eth networking, rln v1 (simple)
- failure modes:
	- missing specs: only docs
	- not reliable (out of date)
	- ambigious , underspercified
- why specs
	- celar requirements for protocol and security guarantess
	- serves as ref and communication tool
	- supportd drobust development and eveolution
	- **not something you outsource**
	- .
- what is is
	- the most valuable asset of a protocol
