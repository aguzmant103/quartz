Why philosophy?
> the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence,

Because it looks for the most important truth.

I want to learn about the following branches in this order:
1. Metaphysics (reality)
2. Epistemology (knowledge)
3. Ethics (morality)
4. Logic (reasoning)
5. Aesthetics (beauty)
6. Political Philosophy (government)
7. Philosophy of Science (science methods)
I want to learn about:
- Sofists
- Socrates
- Post-Truth philosophy
