### Excitement and Focus

>**“But what should I build?”**
Whatever will get you out of bed in the morning. Whatever you dream about waking and sleeping. Whatever the future must contain, but will not, unless you build it.

> Success isn’t just about innovation; it’s about consistently doing what you should be doing, even when distractions try to pull you away. 💡


> you have to order your interests so that you go super deep on one do something big, then completely retract and go super deep on another, and so on... you’re gonna screw yourself if you do two things at once or are constantly pining for some other interest, and not do anything big in either

### Regarding  Skills Building

> Being the (Pareto) Best in the World
To gain an edge in a competitive world, aim to combine multiple skills in unique ways, positioning yourself on the "Pareto frontier" where you’re the best at the intersection of those skills, making you uniquely qualified to solve specific problems

> Differentiated skills by accident
    - At no point was I trying to gain these skills; I was already operating in low probability regions, doing a lot of things that very few other people do
    - The higher order bit was to do rare things, not try to balance myriad threads of advice
    - look for hardest core technology that lead to differentiated skills
    - High conviction, differentiated mental model changes come from doing unexpected things, unlikely to work
   Uniqueness comes in the overlaps
    - Be really good in a few fields, since it’s almost impossible to become the best in one
    - Things collide and emerge in the overlap that only you can see or execute on
    - Unique perspectives and opportunities often emerge in the overlap of different fields — areas where most of your peers won’t possess minimum competency.
   Look for things without labels
    - Seek out ideas and experiences that resist categorization.
    - The lack of labels often signifies the presence of unique learning and growth opportunities.
