Continuous Product Discovery is discovering and validating product ideas before implementing them. Below is a quick introduction, links to resources, and Notion templates you can use to start immediately.

## Why do we need Product Discovery?

According to Marty Cagan, “_The first truth is that at least half of your ideas are just not going to work”_ - Inspired. Thus, learning by implementing ideas results in waste and rework.

### **What can go wrong?**

It happens because, for every solution idea, 5 risks can materialize:

- Value. Will it create value for the customers?
- Usability. Will users figure out how to use it?
- Viability. Can our business support it?
- Feasibility. Can it be done (technology)?
- Ethic. Should we do it? Are there any ethical considerations?

### **Dual-Track Agile**

Jeff Patton, Marty Cagan, and others in the product space have been big proponents of [Dual-Track Development](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/dual-track-development/) or [Dual-Track Agile](https://www.svpg.com/dual-track-agile/). In this setup:

- The goal of Product Discovery is to discover the product to build.
- The goal of Product Delivery is to deliver that product to the market.

Product Discovery results in a validated product backlog. In particular, high-risk assumptions are tested before selecting ideas for implementation

## What’s inside Product Discovery?


![[Pasted image 20241112001333.png]]
There are two groups of activities:

- **Exploring the Problem Space**:
    - Discover: Performing [](https://www.notion.so/772c8b7786c54d739a5c465bf2aadb38?pvs=21)(at least weekly). You can also utilize product analytics, interview internal stakeholders, perform surveys, etc.
    - Define: My favorite approach is mapping [](https://www.notion.so/433a915de3ee41518082557dde262406?pvs=21)(Opportunity Solution Tree)
- **Exploring the Solution Space**:
    - Develop: Explore possible solutions to those problems -[](https://www.notion.so/289aad3b60b54c7bbb83fcc70186d1f5?pvs=21)
    - Test: Formulate testable [](https://www.notion.so/362bf4569ac04a59941f17d1415402f3?pvs=21)related to those ideas. Run experiments to prove or disprove those [](https://www.notion.so/362bf4569ac04a59941f17d1415402f3?pvs=21).

Continuous Product Discovery is performed by the Product Trio (Product Manager, Designer, and at least one Engineer) working together. It’s essential. Every person brings their unique experience and perspective to the table.

## Initial vs. Continuous Product Discovery

This template is adjusted to Continuous Product Discovery.

The Initial Product Discovery starts without Product Delivery. Its goal is to discover a product that has a chance of achieving Product-Market Fit.

You might be able to adjust the template. In that case, follow the Lean Product Playbook process defined by Dan Olsen. The main difference will be working more with MVP prototypes. For more information, see the resources below.
