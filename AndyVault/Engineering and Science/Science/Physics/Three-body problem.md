In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), specifically [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the **three-body problem** is to take the initial positions and velocities (or [momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")) of three [point masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass "Point mass") that orbit each other in space and calculate their subsequent trajectories using [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#cite_note-PrincetonCompanion-1)

Unlike the [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem"), the three-body problem has no general [closed-form solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression "Closed-form expression"), meaning there is no equation that always solves it.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#cite_note-PrincetonCompanion-1) When three bodies orbit each other, the resulting [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") is [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") for most [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition "Initial condition"). Because there are no solvable equations for most three-body systems, the only way to predict the motions of the bodies is to estimate them using [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_method "Numerical method").

The three-body problem is a special case of the [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem"). Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem#cite_note-first-2) In an extended modern sense, a three-body problem is any problem in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") or [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") that models the motion of three particles.
