### **What is a Wave?**  
In physics, a **wave** is a disturbance or oscillation that travels through [[space and time]], often transporting energy. Unlike [[particles]], waves are **delocalized**, meaning they spread out over an area or through a medium. Waves don't have a fixed position; they exist in patterns of peaks and troughs (high and low points) that move in a certain direction.

#### **Examples of Waves:**
1. **Mechanical Waves** (need a medium like air or water to propagate):
   - **Sound Waves**: Vibrations in air molecules that travel to your ears.
   - **Water Waves**: Oscillations on the surface of water when disturbed.

2. **Electromagnetic Waves** (do not need a medium; they travel through a vacuum):
   - **Light Waves**: Waves of electric and magnetic fields (like visible light).
   - **Radio Waves**: Low-frequency electromagnetic waves used in communication.

3. **Matter Waves** (de Broglie waves associated with particles):
   - **Electron Waves**: Electrons exhibit wave properties when diffracted.
   - **Neutron Waves**: Neutrons behave like waves in certain experiments.

#### **How to Understand Waves Conceptually:**
A wave can be thought of as a **pattern of motion**—it’s not an object but an oscillation that spreads through space. For example, sound waves are pressure changes traveling through the air. Light waves, on the other hand, are fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields moving through space.

### **[[particle]] vs. [[Wave]] Comparison**

| **Aspect**      | **Particle**                               | **Wave**                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**    | Localized (exists at a specific point)     | Delocalized (spreads over space)                                     |
| **Behavior**    | Moves in straight paths or trajectories    | Propagates in oscillating patterns                                   |
| **Interaction** | Interacts through forces (like collisions) | Interferes and creates patterns (like in the double-slit experiment) |
| **Examples**    | Electron, proton, neutron, photon          | Sound waves, light waves, water waves                                |

### **Conceptual Summary**
- A **particle** is a localized object with identifiable properties like mass or charge.  
- A **wave** is an oscillation or disturbance that spreads out over space, carrying energy but not being confined to a single point.

In quantum mechanics, the challenge is that **the same entity can behave like both** a particle and a wave, depending on how you observe it. For instance, an **electron** acts like a particle when you measure its position but behaves like a wave when it passes through a double-slit and interferes with itself.
