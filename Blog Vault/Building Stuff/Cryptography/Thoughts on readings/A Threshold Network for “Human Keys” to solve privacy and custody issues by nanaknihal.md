[[Threshold Verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (tVOPRF)]] means a network of servers compute a PRF over a secret key in an oblivious (not learning the secret key), in a threshold (t of n) and verifiable way (ZKP of correct execution)

> Flow: User send a secret value with high entropy to a network of servers and gets back a computed value (identity commitment?)

Problem with current nullifiers:
- Either is generated by a value that the Government could have, or
- Are generated by a new value the user has to keep (secret key), or
- Are generated using an app value (which could collude to deanonimize or have tricks to attack)
How this can help?
