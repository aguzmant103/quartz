In [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics "Orbital mechanics"), a **porkchop plot** is a chart that shows [level curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_curve "Level curve") of equal [characteristic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_energy "Characteristic energy") (C3) against combinations of launch date and arrival date for a particular interplanetary flight. The chart shows the characteristic energy ranges in zones around the [local minima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_minima "Local minima"), which resembles the shape of a porkchop slice.

- (horizontal axis: departure [dates in mm/dd notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States "Date and time notation in the United States"), vertical axis: arrival dates (mm/dd))
- A given blue contour represents a solution with a constant C3.
- The center of the porkchop is the optimal solution for the lowest C3.
- The red lines represent trips with the same travel time for the trajectory.
- The green lines represent the Sun-Earth-Probe angle upon departure.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]



By examining the results of the porkchop plot, engineers can determine when a launch opportunity exists (a '[launch window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window "Launch window")') that is compatible with the capabilities of a particular spacecraft.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porkchop_plot#cite_note-2) A given contour, called a **porkchop curve**, represents constant C3, and the center of the porkchop the optimal minimum C3. The [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements") of the solution, where the fixed values are the departure date, the arrival date, and the length of the flight, were first solved mathematically in 1761 by [Johann Heinrich Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert"), and the equation is generally known as [Lambert's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_problem "Lambert's problem") (or theorem).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porkchop_plot#cite_note-Goldman-1)
